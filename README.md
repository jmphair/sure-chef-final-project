## Project Build Description

As part of our LHL Bootcamp experience, we were given 10 days to plan and build a web app of our choice.

For this fullstack project our team went with a PERN stack to ensure our final product was dynamic and scalable. Because of the tight time frame we chose to use a Vite scaffold to make our development process more agile.

## Why SureChef?

Are you tired of staring into your fridge, wondering what to cook for your next meal? Do you find yourself constantly running to the grocery store because you forgot to stock up on essential ingredients? If you answered yes to either of these questions, then SureChef is here to help.

While we may not have robot assistants in every kitchen yet, SureChef is the next best thing. Our AI-powered platform allows you to keep track of your kitchen inventory and generates recipe ideas for you based on the ingredients you have on hand.

With SureChef, you'll never have to worry about wasting food or struggling to come up with meal ideas again. Our platform makes cooking easy and convenient, helping you save time and money in the kitchen.

So why wait for the future of robotic cooking assistants when you can start using SureChef today? Sign up now and experience the benefits of having your own personal AI-powered chef.
